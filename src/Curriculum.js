					    This is our most common programme, we cover all 3 topics and make sure girls understand the basics on each and are able to make informed decisions. 
						Participants are shown various images such as the Mona Lisa, a £10 note and a pearl and are asked the value of it, leading into an explanation on an individual’s pricelessness. This leads into a video on how pearls and diamonds are made and how pressure creates strength. This section ends with how self-discipline affects our thoughts and help students be healtier and happier 
						Next we cover Her Bra and Kemi discusses the moment she realised that a bra was not a sexual object to be leered at but part of a woman’s uniform and it could be as pretty or as basic as she desired but it was not just meant for others, it was Hers. An interactive poll is taken on how many girls feel like they know their bra size. How to choose the right bra is then explained, this leads into Her Period  and another interactive poll is taken to show who thinks they understand how their period works. A woman’s menstrual cycle is explained and this leads into the final session of Her-Self-esteem which is HerPurpose, here it is explained that every person has a purpose and the balance between dreaming big and implementing basic healthy habits into our lives
						The programme ends with a Q&A session.
						Topics covered: Her Period, Her Bra and Her Self-esteem.
